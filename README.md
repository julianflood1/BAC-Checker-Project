_In your preferred database management system (I use SSMS), open the bac_checker.sql file from the project folder. Run the execute command on the file. If this does not work, run the following command in SQLCMD:

CREATE DATABASE bac_checker; GO USE bac_checker; GO CREATE TABLE patrons (id INT IDENTITY(1,1), name VARCHAR(100), gender VARCHAR(25), weight INT, height INT, bmi INT); GO CREATE TABLE drinks (id INT IDENTITY(1,1), name VARCHAR(50), drink_type VARCHAR(50), abv DECIMAL(3,1), cost DECIMAL(4,2)); GO CREATE TABLE orders (id INT IDENTITY(1,1), patrons_id INT, drinks_id INT); GO

_To create test database, in your preferred database management system (I use SSMS) open the bac_checker_test.sql file from the project folder. Run the execute command on the file. If this does not work, back up and restore the database as a test database in your preferred database management system.

_In PowerShell, cd into the project folder. Enter the command > **dnu restore**_
